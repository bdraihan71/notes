- OSI (Open System Interconnection) Model, What is **`OSI`** Model? 
    - In Layme's terms, the OSI model provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other. 
    - From cloudflare blog: [link](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)
    - In Brief 
        - The open systems interconnection model is a conceptual model created by the international organization for standardiazation which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. 
        - In plain english the osi provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other. 
        - It's based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last 
            1. Application layer 
            2. Presentation layer 
            3. Session layer 
            4. Transport layer 
            5. Network layer 
            6. Datalink layer 
            7. Physical layer 
        - Why does it matter ? 
            - The modern internet doesn't strictly follow the osi model the osi model is still very useful for troubleshooting network problems. 
            - It helps to break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble.

- TCP/IP Model 
    - It is a 4 layer model 
        1. Application layer 
        2. Transport layer 
        3. Internet layer 
        4. Network Access layer
