# Benefits of Using KVM

##Some of the benefits of using KVM are:

- It is an open source solution, and, as such, free to customize.
- Using KVM is efficient from a financial perspective as well, due to the lower costs associated with it.
- It provides efficient hardware-assisted virtualization for an array of guest OSes, such as Linux, BSD, Solaris, Windows, Mac OS, ReactOS, and Haiku.
- It provides para-virtualization of Ethernet cards, disk I/O controllers, and graphical interfaces for a set of guest OSes, such as Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Windows.
- It is highly scalable.
- KVM employs advanced security features, utilizing SELinux. It provides MAC (Mandatory Access Control) security between Virtual Machines. KVM has received awards for meeting common government and military security standards and for allowing open virtualization for homeland security projects.
