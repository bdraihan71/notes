# Introduction To Cloud Computing

> Course from linux foundation

## Cloud Computing

- It can be referred to as the remote allocation of resources on the cloud. It offers various services built on top of basic provisioning and releasing of resources. Most of these service models fall into one of the following categories.
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Key Features of Cloud Computing

- Speed and Agility
  - Cloud resources are provisioned with a few clicks, saving time and providing agility. They also scale up or down with ease, by increasing or decreasing the number of running instances of a particular resource as a response to current demand or based on projected future demand. An additional characteristic is elasticity, allowing some cloud resources instances to increase or decrease in size, also demand-driven.
- Cost
  - By reducing the up-front cost to set up the infrastructure, it allows users to focus on applications supporting the business processes. Another beneficial feature of cloud providers is a cost estimator, which assists users in better resource planning.
- Easy Access to Resources
  - Users can access the cloud services from any place and device, as long as there is connectivity to the cloud service provider.
- Maintenance
  - All the lights-on maintenance work to keep resources up, running, and up-to-date is offloaded onto the provider, and it is no longer the user's concern.
- Multi-tenancy
  - Multiple users sharing the same pool of resources, which helps to drive down the costs incurred by each user.
- Reliability
  - Resources can be hosted in different data center locations, to provide increased reliability, resiliency, and high-availability

## Cloud Deployment Models

- Private Cloud
  - It is designated and operated solely for one organization. It can be hosted internally or externally and managed by internal teams or a third party. A private cloud can be built using a software stack like OpenStack.
- Public Cloud
  - It is open to the public and anybody can use it, after swiping a credit card, of course. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure are examples of public clouds.
- Hybrid Cloud

  - Public and private clouds can be bound together to offer a hybrid cloud. Such hybrid clouds are beneficial for:
    - Storage of sensitive information on the private cloud, while offering public services based on that information from a public cloud.
    - Meeting temporary resources during peak or times of high demand by scaling to the cloud, when such temporary resources cannot be met on the private cloud.

- Community Cloud
  - Formed by multiple organizations sharing a common cloud infrastructure.
- Distributed Cloud
  - Formed by distributed systems connected to a single network.
- Multicloud
  - One organization uses multiple public cloud providers to run its workload, typically to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Poly Cloud
  - One organization uses multiple public cloud providers to leverage specific services from each provider.
