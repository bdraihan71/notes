# Some Common Design Pattern

## Singleton Pattern
- It restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 
- Singleton is a design pattern which lets us to handle multiple classes with one instance.
- Suppose a DB instance can be handle by only one connection, it may be used by multiple objects. But all can access the database with only one single connection. 
- Using multiple connection for these multiple objects can be very costly. 

## Facade Pattern 
- Facade is the frontend of every framework. Think like the front side of a house, where door window and a wall is being seen rather than the inside mass which is being hidden. 

## Bridge Pattern 
- A pattern that enables the use of multiple implementations. 
- Like using driver for database. 
- It allows us to separate the abstraction from the implementation
