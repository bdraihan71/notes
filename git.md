# Git Basics

> Some basics on git

- Create a new branch: **`git checkout -b dev`**
- Switch to branch: **`git checkout dev`**
- Check the changes on a branch or something: **`git diff dev`**
- Just checkout the changes: **`git diff`**
- Merge specific branch with the **main** branch: **`git merge dev`**
- To see the changes of others: **`git diff --ours`** && **`git diff --theirs`**
- To cancel the merge: **`git merge --abort`**
