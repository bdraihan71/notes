# Data Structures 

> notes on data structures 

## Study 

	- Logical View.

	- Operations. 

	- Cost of Operations. 

	- Implementation. 

## Deffinition 

	A Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently. 

	- We talk about Mathmatical/Logical models.

	- We mainly work with searching and sorting algorithms. 

	- Abstract Data Type. 


## Abstract Data Type (ADT)

	- Store a given number of elements of any type. 

	- Read elements by position. 

	- Modify element at a position. 

	- Define data and operations but no implementation. 

	- We can implement this with linked list.  

## Arrays (Concrete Implementation)
