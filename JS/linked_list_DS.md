# Linked List Data Structure

> Doc on JavaScript Linked List Data Structure

## Basic

- It's a **linear Data Structure**.
- It's a **Ordered Collection of Data**.
- The elements or nodes are not stored in sequential memory locations.
- They are linked together using a pointer.
- The first node is the head.
- Then a pointer or a reference to next element.

## How it Works!!

- After putting al the data the last data goes to the first.
